# IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Zerops

Each [project]() you create gets assigned a **unique IPv6 address** as part of core functionality that can be either used to set up [direct access]() (with optional firewall protection) to any of the project's [services]() or as your **AAAA record** and setting up the [domain access]().

As IPv6 is not widely used, you can activate a **unique IPv4 address** as a paid add-on for each project. It is helpful for the production environment, as this address can be used as your **A record**. A unique IPv4 address costs [$8 per 30 days]() and it's not possible to use free Zerops credit to purchase one. Payment is deducted upon first use for a specific project. Its drawdown is calculated in days, taking into account the time of the first add-on activation. The amount is never refundable. An IPv4 released from one project can be activated on another until its total time limit is exhausted.

Another alternative is using **a free** [shared IPv4 address](/documentation/routing/using-shared-ipv4.html) ( ==`93.185.106.19`== ), but be sure you understand its specifics.

If you need to access your development/stage/preview projects, you should use the [Zerops sub-domains']() free functionality.
