# Company & Users

You can sign up using your email or your [GitHub](/documentation/github/login-with-github.html) or [GitLab](/documentation/gitlab/login-with-gitlab.html) account. You will then be able to create a company account of which you will be an administrator. You can then invite other team members to this company account. There is no limit on the number of team members you can invite, as we [encourage](/documentation/overview/made-for-developers.html#each-developer-should-have-his-own-account-no-artificial-pricing-boosting) each developer to have their own account and their own copy of each project.

::: warning On roles
Currently, in the private beta version, we do not have a role / restriction system implemented yet. We plan to have that done by the time we reach the production stage.
