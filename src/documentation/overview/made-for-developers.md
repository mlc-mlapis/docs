# Made for Developers

From the very beginning, our goal was to make DevOps as easy and straightforward for developers as possible. It's great when you can move your infrastructure to the cloud, but not so great when you need to hire _that cloud app's_ certified engineer to set everything up properly. And wait forever while he does so. Not to mention the invoice they'll inevitably send.

We took our 14 years' [experience](https://vshosting.eu/about) of providing managed cloud solutions for developers and turned it into Zerops. Not only do we aim to make Zerops a great solution for production, but also a helpful tool for local development. As such, we [encourage](/documentation/overview/made-for-developers.html#each-developer-should-have-his-own-account-no-artificial-pricing-boosting) each environment and each team member to have their own infrastructure copy. On Zerops, there is no limit on the number of team members or projects you can add. On top of that, each service is free for the basic level.

### Each developer should have his own account, no artificial pricing boosting

To be able to fully utilize Zerops, each developer should have their own account and, if it makes sense for the project, their own copy of the project too. That's why we don't charge extra or put limits on the number of projects or number of team members. You only pay for performance and add-ons.

### Empower you local development

Using our [zCLI](/documentation/cli/installation-authorization.html#installation), you can connect securely to your project using a built-in [VPN](/documentation/cli/vpn.html). This means you can connect locally to a database running on Zerops, so you don't need to have it running locally. Each developer can have their own copy of the project. This can also be used to securely import data to a database - any service running inside the project will instantaneously become available securely on your computer.

### Always open to new ideas
