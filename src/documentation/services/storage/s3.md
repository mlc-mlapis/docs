## Adding the Object Storage Service in Zerops

### Used technology

Zerops Object Storage is based on the [Ceph cluster](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/architecture) technology in the [v15.2 OCTOPUS](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/releases/octopus) version with one namespace shared by all Zerops accounts (similar to [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html)), providing interfaces compatible with most of the Amazon S3 RESTful API. This means that after a bucket is created, the name of that bucket cannot be used by another Zerops account until the bucket is deleted.

You can choose any bucket naming conventions you want, but **we recommend the following logic**, which should **guarantee a very high level of reliability and conflict avoidance for all Zerops accounts**.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip Zerops recommendation for bucket naming conventions
A unique random **serviceId** with a 22-character-long internal value (see also [Storage access details](#from-a-local-environment)) is generated for each Zerops service instance. By using this value as a bucket name prefix, you can ensure that any of your created bucket names will be unique among all other ones across the entire Zerops namespace.

**Recommended syntax**: `<serviceId>.<bucketName>`

Use this prefix value consistently for each created bucket name. Because it's a soft rule, it cannot provide 100% certainty. Therefore, we recommend you always use existence checking for new bucket names. There is a small, albeit very unlikely, possibility that other users will accidentally use such a combination of characters if they choose not to follow our recommendation.

### Which version to choose

You can currently only choose version **v1.0**. The chosen version **can't be changed afterwards**.

Used as the export & import type: ==`object-storage@1`== .

### Object storage name

Choose a short and descriptive URL-friendly name, for example, **store**. The following rules apply:

* maximum length **==25==** characters,
* only lowercase ASCII letters **==a-z==** and numbers **==0-9==**,
* **==has to be unique==** in relation to other existing project hostnames,
* the object storage name **==can't be changed==** later.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip Relation between object storage names and hostnames
There's only one namespace for all service hostnames, shared storage names, and object storage names. Each one has to be unique.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip
The object storage name is also automatically used to create a user account under which all buckets and objects are subsequently created. This user is, therefore, their **owner with full access rights**. See the [Object storage owner identity](#object-storage-owner-identity) section for more information. ==**You can't create any new users on your own.**==

Creating different object storage services and thus **different users** allows you to set different ACL settings to get required [access rights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html), including canned ACL such as [public read/write access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) ([see examples](/documentation/services/storage/s3.html#from-runtime-services-inside-the-project)) across all your object storage services in any combination.

<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

### API URL endpoint and port

The Zerops Object Storage service is accessible at [https://s3.app.zerops.io](https://s3.app.zerops.io). The port is always set to the default value of HTTPS protocol **==443==** and can't be changed.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip
The object storage cluster is running in HA mode (with multiple node flexibility controlled by Zerops) as a directly accessible service from all Zerops project services in the same way and from the outside Internet through an HTTPS protocol. Each new Zerops Object Storage Service creates a reserved and independent space based on the required disk capacity. If you would like to learn more about the technical details and how this service is built internally, take a look at the [Object Storage Service, Internal](/documentation/overview/how-zerops-works-inside/ceph-cluster-internally.html) section of the documentation.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

### Required disk capacity

You can choose the maximum amount of data in GB, which will correspond to the volume the created Object Storage Service should be capable of holding. The default value is set to **2 GB**, but you can change it to any value between **1** and **100 GB**.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: warning Manual scaling only
Chosen disk capacity is currently not automatically scaled in any way and needs to be changed manually as needed via the Zerops GUI.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

### Location of Zerops HW infrastructure

Zerops infrastructure is located exclusively in **Europe/Prague**. Nonetheless, the default S3 region option ==**us-east-1**== must be used as a region property value. This option is to minimize any subsequent complications when communicating with various client tools and SDKs.

### Object storage bucket names

The [following rules](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/s3/bucketops/#constraints) apply:

* must be unique in the same shared Zerops region namespace,
* cannot be formatted as an IP address,
* can be between 3 and 63 characters long,
* must not contain uppercase characters or underscores,
* must start with a lowercase letter or a number,
* must be a series of one or more labels separated by a single period ( ==**.**== ),
* can contain only ASCII lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens,
* each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number.

### Number of buckets per service

You can create up to 1000 buckets per one Zerops Object Storage Service.

### Object storage owner identity

For each Zerops Object Storage Service, one account with the same [canonical id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) as the uniquely generated **serviceId** (see also [Storage access details](#from-a-local-environment)) of that instance, is automatically created with the same name as the chosen [Object storage name](#object-storage-name). Under this account, all buckets and objects/files are created, and this user is listed as the owner and is the only one granted the following attributes, for example:

|DisplayName  |ID                        |Type             |
|:------------|:-------------------------|:----------------|
|==**store**==|==0lw7exbutxykmmecyf3dzq==|**CanonicalUser**|

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip User canonical ID
The unique generated **serviceId** (see [Storage access details](#from-a-local-environment)) of the created Zerops Object Storage Service instance is used as the canonical **ID** property above.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

## How to access an object storage service

Other project services can access the object storage using its public [API URL endpoint](#api-url-endpoint-and-port) the same as any access from the outside Internet, including your [local development environment](/documentation/services/storage/s3.html#from-local-environment), through an HTTPS protocol and the default ==**443**== port.

### From runtime services inside the project

In most cases, this will be the way to create application logic within the Zerops runtime environments ([Node.js](/documentation/services/runtimes/nodejs.html), [Golang](/documentation/services/runtimes/golang.html), and [PHP](/documentation/services/runtimes/php.html)) using relevant programming code, ensuring communication and all steps associated with creating and managing buckets as well as their contents.

Each programming language requires slightly different settings. The following examples show some elementary tasks for each. You need to understand each of them and also have knowledge of using appropriate SDKs for more advanced cases and real applications.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip How to update the content of existing objects
There is no dedicated method to update an object's content. Overwrite it using the same way you created it. But you can specify other object settings (ACL, Tags, …), see [supported API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Aws.S3.S3Client.html).
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

It's always recommended to not place configuration values as constants directly into the application code. It's better to use them indirectly, for example, via [custom environment variables](/knowledge-base/best-practices/how-to-use-environment-variables-efficiently.html), referencing Zerops [implicit environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables/helper-variables.htm) and given that [all environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables/how-to-access.html) are shared within the project across all services. Another reason not to hard-code the values inside your applications is that there is a danger of easily committing them (like your credentials) into a repository, potentially exposing them to more people than intended.

### From a local environment

The local environment offers ==**not only possibilities for local development**== but also a general ability to ==**manage all Zerops development or production services**== , using zcli VPN.

As mentioned above, the Zerops Object Storage service is directly accessible using its public [API URL endpoint](#api-url-endpoint-and-port) through an HTTPS protocol. So for this unique case, you don't need to utilize the [VPN](/documentation/cli/vpn.html) functionality of our [Zerops zcli](/documentation/cli/installation.html), unlike all other Zerops services.

Because the code runs from the outside of your Zerops project's network, you cannot use references to the environment variables. Therefore, if you need them, you should copy the values manually through the "**How To Access** / **Storage access details**“ section of the service detail in your application and use them in your private local configuration strategy.

#### Using Rclone as a local management tool

We want to mention [Rclone](https://rclone.org) as it's an excellent OSS project on [GitHub](https://github.com/rclone/rclone) with CLI & GUI interfaces, allowing you to browse and manage objects/files on Zerops object storage services.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: warning Use for backup/restore operations
To a certain extent, it's possible to also use it for fundamental backups & restores. The essence of this restriction is that it works only with objects and files and not with their extended data structures, such as ACLs and metadata. When it's necessary to use them, for example, when transferring data from a local file system to a Zerops S3 compatible object storage service, it's possible to use a pre-defined setting for which such structures will be set.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

Installation is straightforward, as you can see in the [instructions](https://rclone.org/install). To config Zerops object storage service data access, run the config wizard using the command ==`rclone config`== , follow the instructions and default options. Pay attention to the following steps only when choosing:

|Question                                                                |Answer                                                                   |

|**Choose your S3 provider**                                             |==`Ceph`==                                                               |
|**Enter AWS credentials in the next step**                              |==`false`==                                                              |
|**AWS Access Key ID**                                                   |a value from the Zerops Storage access details ==`Access Key Id`==       |
|**AWS Secret Access Key**                                               |a value from the Zerops Storage access details ==`Secret Access Key`==   |
|**Region to connect to**                                                |==`""`==                                                                 |
|**Endpoint for S3 API**                                                 |a value from the Zerops Storage access details ==`Api Url`==             |
|**Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects**|as you want, probably the default value ==`private`==                    |

After that, you can run [commands](https://rclone.org/commands). For example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip Using a simplified bucket name
As explained earlier, the standard way to get a unique name of a bucket is using a randomly generated prefix that guarantees a high probability of uniqueness, such as an internal ID of each Zerops service. To simplify the syntax of the following examples, we use only the ==`records`== bucket name.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

|Command                                            |Result                                                                                        |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|==`rclone lsd store:`==                            |Lists all existing buckets in the named remote `store`.                                         |
|==`rclone ls store:`==                             |Lists all existing object/files in the named remote `store`.                                    |
|==`rclone ls store:records`==                      |Lists existing object/files in the `records` bucket.                                            |
|==`rclone copy store:records C:/Data/Records`==    |Copies all object/files from the `records` bucket to a local path in the file system on Windows.|
|==`rclone copy store:records /usr/<user>/records`==|Copies all object/files from the `records` bucket to a local path in the file system on Linux.  |
|==`rclone copy C:/Data/Records store:records`==    |Copies all files from a local path in the file system on Windows to the `records` bucket.       |
|==`rclone copy /usr/<user>/records store:records`==|Copies all files from a local path in the file system on Linux to the `records` bucket.         |

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: tip What to use as keys for objects/files
The equivalent of an object/file key is a file name in a local file system. In this case, it's practical to always use a file name (including an extension) as the key, even for objects, such as `*.txt` or `*.json`. This allows you to open such a file easily later on.
:::
<!-- markdownlint-enable DOCSMD004 -->

You can also run the command ==`rclone rcd --rc-web-gui --rc-user=<user> --rc-pass=<pass>`== to locally serve a web based [GUI](https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react) of Rclone. The optional parameters `rc-user` and `rc-pass` allow you to choose your own defined values to secure the environment.

## Data protection in Zerops Object Storage

Zerops S3 compatible [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/architecture) object storage cluster provides similar storage infrastructure as AWS S3. Objects/files are redundantly stored on multiple HW devices, and their durability is maintained by quickly detecting and repairing any lost redundancy. All this guarantees 99.99999 % data availability at any given moment.

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD004 -->
::: warning Accidentally deleted data
Zerops does not ensure the back availability of accidentally deleted data to the user in any way. You have to protect against such cases yourself. For example, using more Zerops object storage services and periodical backing up versioned data sets among them or syncing data between Zerops and other environments, including local file systems.
