This allowed us to create a powerful, [high availability enabled](/documentation/ha/why-should-i-want-high-availability.html) platform with blazing fast load balancing and autoscaling capabilities and each service optimized for the best possible performance at any level of [automatic scaling](/documentation/automatic-scaling/how-automatic-scaling-works.html).
